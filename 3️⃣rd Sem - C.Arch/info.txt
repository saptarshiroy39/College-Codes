This project uses "Xilinx ISE" for VHDL/Verilog development and simulation.

All hardware description files and simulations are written specifically for "Xilinx FPGA" compatibility.

Please ensure that you are using "Xilinx ISE Design Suite" or a compatible environment for proper synthesis and simulation of the hardware description code.
